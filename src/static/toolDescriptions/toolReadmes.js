### What is this?
**Whitespace Remover** is a tool to remove all unwanted multiple whitespaces and line-breaks from a text. When we are typing in hurry, we often make mistakes like giving extra tabs or spaces in the text but we are not aware at that time. And it is a tedious task to find such extra spaces in a large text of like 700-800 words. It is similar to finding a needle in a heap of grass.

### Example

**Original text :**
<pre>
Fermentum           quis primis hac torquent. Augue sociosqu felis consequat adipiscing. Maecenas fermentum per habitant cubilia. Lectus egestas sociosqu            taciti neque. Suscipit lobortis aliquam volutpat eleifend. Vehicula nibh               viverra dui morbi. Potenti nisl senectus orci commodo.              Suscipit ridiculus               convallis lectus finibus. Imperdiet amet eget               felis erat. Auctor convallis porta lacus ultrices.
</pre>

**Formatted text :**

### What is this?
**Letter Counter** is a free online tool for counting letters, words, and sentences in a text. When you are writing an essay, article, report, or any other thing then you always need to check the number of characters. Also in some of the social media platforms, there are certain limits on the length of content. So, the Letter Counter tool helps in that. It gives you the total count of letters/characters in a piece of text. Just paste your text and it'll display the counts of characters, sentences, and words. 

It also supports run-time counting, so you can directly start typing here and the count gets updated every time you edit the text. It will become easier for you to decide how much you have to write or have written.

### Example

Fermentum quis primis hac torquent. Augue sociosqu felis consequat adipiscing. Maecenas fermentum per habitant cubilia. Lectus egestas sociosqu taciti neque. Suscipit lobortis aliquam volutpat eleifend. Vehicula nibh viverra dui morbi. Potenti nisl senectus orci commodo. Suscipit ridiculus convallis lectus finibus. Imperdiet amet eget felis erat. Auctor convallis porta lacus ultrices.
